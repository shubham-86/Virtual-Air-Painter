# virtual-Air-Painter
This project is about using openCV and mediapipe libraries to utilize the webcamera for drawing in real time.
The main idea is:
detect hands using mediapipe
detect wheither the index and middle fingers are up
detect fingers' tip location
draw a line when only the index finger is up and make a sellection when both index and middle fingers are up
draw on a black canvas then mask it with actual frame
